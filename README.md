# Play-with-React-A-Journey-Through-React-Projects
Welcome to Play with React, a collection of fun and interactive React.js projects! 🎨⚛️ This repository documents my learning journey as I explore React and build cool projects along the way. Whether you're a beginner looking for inspiration or an experienced developer revisiting core concepts, I hope this repo adds value to your learning.

# 🎬 MovieZone 🎥

**MovieZone** is a beginner-friendly React project where I explored essential React concepts like **map**, **filter**, **useState**, **event handling**, and **folder structuring**.

This project helped me understand how to manage state, render lists dynamically, and structure a React app properly.

## 📚 What I Learned

✅ **useState Hook** – Managing component state  
✅ **Event Handling** – Handling user interactions  
✅ **Array Methods** – Using `map()` & `filter()` to render dynamic lists  
✅ **Component Structure** – Organizing components effectively  
✅ **Folder Structure** – Understanding React's project organization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite  
- **Styling:** CSS3, Bootstrap
